    description: `Europa Habitat and Composition Observation (ECHO) Lander

Designed a full ADCS architecture for a lander mission to Europa, targeting autonomous operation through a six-month science phase on Europa's icy surface.

- Developed and validated a pyramid configuration of 4 reaction wheels to ensure three-axis control with one-axis redundancy in case of failure.
- Integrated 2 star trackers, 2 IMUs, and 1 3-axis magnetometer into the sensor suite.
- Personally built a MATLAB-based star tracker pipeline capable of:
  ‚Ä¢ Identifying stars in optical imagery using centroid extraction and SURF feature detection.
  ‚Ä¢ Matching stars with a custom Hipparcos-based catalog (Vmag ‚â§ 5.5) using knnsearch.
  ‚Ä¢ Computing attitude via Wahba's problem and quaternion estimation with confidence weighting.
- Performed trade studies for component selection under a 25 kg ADCS mass budget
- Validated FEA for structural interfaces and conducted risk assessments for high-radiation environments.`,

    description: `I designed and analyzed a high-speed UAV capable of atmospheric flight 40 km above Jupiter's surface.

  Encounter conditions:
  ‚Ä¢ 10 kPa pressure
  ‚Ä¢ 100 K temperature
  ‚Ä¢ Mach 7.5 flight speed
  ‚Ä¢ Headwinds up to 400 m/s

  Material choice: Aluminum 6061-T6, chosen for high strength at cryogenic temperatures.

  I performed FEA with curvature-based mesh refinement for maximum loads of 137 kN due to gusts and descent.

  My stress pipeline included:
  ‚Ä¢ Text-to-geometry generation for cross-section
  ‚Ä¢ Calculation of Ixx, Iyy, Ixy for torsion and bending stress analysis
  ‚Ä¢ Simulation of spar/boom elements and calculation of von Mises stress and safety factors
  ‚Ä¢ Estimation of fatigue life and deflection under worst-case loading

  I determined that drag was negligible (~5 kN), enabling energy-efficient descent, and concluded that 
  sustained UAV cruise flight on Jupiter is plausible if deployment hurdles are met.`,

    description: `As part of a two-person team, I co-led the development of a novel sensor platform‚Äîthe Deformation-Displacement Array (DDA)‚Äîdesigned to digitally capture and analyze the surface geometry of deformable objects in real time. The original concept aimed to improve orthopedic solutions by enabling rapid, customized orthotic manufacturing using dynamic shape data.

Early efforts focused on physical prototyping: I designed and assembled a 16-pin sensor array using compression springs, linear potentiometers, and an Arduino-based data logging system. However, due to resolution constraints and limitations in hardware scalability, I pivoted the project toward a software-first proof of concept, using high-fidelity simulations to showcase the system's potential.

I developed an end-to-end simulation pipeline using MATLAB and Python to model displacement, force, pressure, stress, and strain profiles for various objects on a virtual DDA array. These tools enabled visual and analytical exploration of use cases across orthotics, soft robotics, and scientific instrumentation. I also integrated 3D scanned mesh data (via iPhone LiDAR) into our simulation environment and collaborated with VFX faculty to render detailed system visuals in Houdini.

The final deliverable demonstrated the DDA sensor as a scalable, modular solution for dynamic surface mapping, with potential applications in prosthetics, wearable tech, and orthotic kiosks. We conducted external consultations with physicians from UPMC and discussed pathways toward FDA approval and eventual market deployment.

This project sharpened my skills in hardware prototyping, simulation modeling, data visualization, interdisciplinary collaboration, and real-world validation of engineering concepts.`,
